Append allocates the new value to the end of the array, which doesnt change the already exsisting values.
While, insert allocates the new value to the beginning of the array, which changes the indices of the values in the array.
The insert function takes less time the smaller the array is but grows exponentionaly the bigger the array.
While, the append function stays linear until the end. Append scales better because it stays much more linear.

Extra Credit- The methods push() and unshift() are used to add an element in an array. 
But they have a slight variation. The method push() is used to add an element at the end of the array, 
whereas the method unshift() is used to add the element at the start of the array.

Because unshift () has to increment all the elements that already present in the Array. 
But, push () has to insert an element at the end of the array, so none of the Array elements' index has to change. 
But, push () can also be said with Complexity of O (n) because of dynamic allocation of memory.
